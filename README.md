## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - JS framework
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Starting a project with Vue after more than 3 years of using React/JSX is such a fun and interesting experience. I really like how this project turned out and reminded me how delightful the developer experience is when using Vue.

For the mobile layout I've improved the cart position to be a toggle-able modal so users don't need to scroll down every time to view the cart.

### Continued development

Adding some animations on adding/deleting items on the cart would be nice
